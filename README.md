# Developers Dark Theme

![version number](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/version/BigTechTalk.developers-dark-theme.svg)

Hi All,

I make video on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC70FzDDRiJZ6BUyxmolBXow) where i do a lot of coding and while doing so i realized that the colour contrast is must in your ide.

This is the reason i came up with [Developers Dark Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=BigTechTalk.developers-dark-theme) . This theme came out from these minor changes that to make sure code is visible and look good on screen.

Will try to maintain the and upgrade the theme.
